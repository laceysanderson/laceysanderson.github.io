name: Lacey-Anne Sanderson

position: Bioinformatics Research Assistant, Pulse Crop Research
employer: University of Saskatchewan, Plant Sciences

intro: Formally trained in botony and molecular biology with a sprinkling of computer science and practically trained in web development and plant breeding, I often feel like I'm straddling two worlds and belong in neither of them, which is just to say, I am a Bioinformaticist ;-). People either know me as the lead developer of KnowPulse or one of the core developers of Tripal --luckily they are both an end to the same mean.
